# JOURN-124

I chose the question "Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?" because it is a very common real-life situation that people tend to disagee on, making it interesting to see how these opinions vary. It was surprising to see that over 80% felt that it was not rude. My chart shows the number of people who chose each response and it reveals that most people do not mind switching to an unsold seat. This can suggest that norms on seat-switching may be more relaxed than people thought.
